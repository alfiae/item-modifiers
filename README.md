# Item Modifiers

## About
**Item Modifiers** is a mod that is very much inspired by Terraria's modifiers system and shamelessly implements it into Minecraft.

Currently, it supports all modifiers besides ones pertaining to magic.

As the mod is currently, the only way to obtain a modifier is to get a new item, however that is subject to change if/when I work on this project more.
