# Item Modifiers

## About
Item Modifiers is a mod that is very much inspired by Terraria's modifiers system and shamelessly implements it into Minecraft.

Warning - Item Modifiers changes how Minecraft tooltips are rendered. Compatibility with mods that modify an item's tooltip in any way is not guaranteed.

This mod *can* function without its client-sided capabilities, however items with modified damage / attack speed will have out-of-place tooltips, and you will be unable to see the percentage modifiers an item has in its tooltip either.
